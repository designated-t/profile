There is a strange misconception on what artificiality poses,
And we all are guilty for expressing this idea in wordly doses,
We are birthed from natural means,
Yet nothing we make is natural, it seems.

But suppose we find our creations complete,
As nature intends,
And we create a world beyond ours to make ideas concrete,
With all the bends,

Is this world any lesser than our own?
Is a canvas not as real as a throne?
What even states that something is true or fake?
Because I've created realities realer than whatever nature can make,
Fiction has taught me more about reality than grounding myself ever could,
But lessons told will be disregarded, mocked, never understood,
What one lacks in reality, fills with art,
But lacking expresses a grief, a feature of the heart,
And the blood of a canvas runs as the paint thins and thickens,
And likely fails to adapt when the context itself quickens...
It is true that a canvas lacks veritism,
So perhaps it serves only for temporary escapism.

There are mistakes the mixing brush can't fix,
Absence is expressed in tones that presence could never mix.
