Its beautiful

How the air cools about my cup,
And stops it from warming up,
As the water in the air condensates,
Through many tiny droplets, isolates,
It makes sense.

How the water warms about the sea,
Under the unforgiving sun's decree,
Making clouds, it all evaporates,
Whitely reflects all light in unique states,
It makes sense.

How your eyes, dark and wide, shine so bright,
Wrapping that sight around my chest so tight,
How you calm my every nerve with a voice so slight,
And paradoxically invigorate me with every bite,
It doesn't make sense... But it feels so right.
