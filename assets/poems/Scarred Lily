Didn't think it could ever happen this quickly,
A dump of emotions caught my heart so sickly,
About yours, mine, and everything in between,
Such life experience, and all is written upon the skin with a skean.

I want to tend to the wounds of the past that cause you ache,
I want to carefully gather your pieces, should you ever break,
I want to soothe the nights which seem to scratch your mind with a rake,
And mire all about your wonderful face upon my every wake,

And I will.

For the time I've spent next to you, holding you, feeling you,
I've noticed a tenderness, a want, a necessity to turn blue,
You want to just let go, and sense the past that has bogged you,
Lose yourself, allow you to feel the things that you know are true,
But a barrier persists, a strange self-neglecting facade which you imbue,
And I want to lower it, to make you know you're free of that view,

And I will.

So tell me, my scarred lily: have you felt as I surmise?
Or perhaps I assume too much, my own demise.
Though my intentions are clear, there is far more to be said,
And among them, I have the dire need to make sure never again you're bled,

And I will.
