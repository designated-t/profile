All the stars this night...  
Though next to me exists their fading,
Like a spotlight my vision is evading,

But I'll give in,
Ill turn with the sky,
Making my head spin
As does your every goodbye...

I'll reach the horizon,
Where the land ties in,
And the treasure lays in view...

I'll avoid the stars above, finally pay whats due,
And focus on you.
