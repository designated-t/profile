I breathe a little deeper
When the path gets steeper,
Because a harsh thought
Is only enlightenment well-wrought.
A consequence of progress,
Feeling yourself devolve less.

I'm found in a well paved path,
Crossing one less trodden,
A strath continuing to broaden,
Alluring and enticing, a junction of fates,
Perhaps testing each of my mental states.

Will I only choose the harsh reality
When contentment is my only modality?

Will a branch of my fate die
If by sadness I let a hard choice go by..?

I think... It doesn't matter
Even if its the latter,
Because I've recently learnt to accept my fate,
And the world looks so pretty as of late.
