Beauty's incandescent standard,
Through its fire, unhampered.
One might tell of Icarus' tale...
They lack the essence of her detail.

And praised be the ringed behemoth,
The grand and conquering, allure's zenith.
The faint pale figure, ancient God of time,
And to question its features, such a grave crime.

Yet my eyes lay on the waxing crescent,
The one I've sung to of tales depressant,
The one I've shared my greatest pleasures,
The one I've told of all my treasures
A reflection of my words, she merely repeats,
A perfection of my woes, she keeps no receipts,
Forever my muse, my deepest complexion,
I love her so, my beacon of introspection.
