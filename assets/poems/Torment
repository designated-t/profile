If I had drawn an end then,
By her word and my hand,
I would still have laid my will out for her
And ask her to scribble on what she did not want,
Perhaps allowing her to come to senses of what I posed,
Maybe she would finally allow me a crumb.

"Would my self in a coffin finally instill my self in your thoughts often?"

Then again, this is her,
A psychopathic husk following only her motion,
And even though proven beyond doubt,
I've none she would argue this notion.
But with my words muted by her presence,
I would scarcely disallow her respite.

In my burial, I would receive her once and finally.
My will's only condition.
With only my wandering soul I would allow her no rest.
I'd crawl from my own, 
Grasp at her soles,
Gouge out her skin, 
Pull at her tendons,
Make the rot reach her bones,
I would breed decay in her lungs,
Make sure her brain vibrates only silence, her heart ceases to beat,
But that her soul still weeps.

Because if she will not feel remorse, she will feel torment.
