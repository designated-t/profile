Ive always felt ashamed at being witnessed in the act of wanting something I could not have.

Because, in your presence, my thoughts are limitless, but your touch ceases what I never deemed possible to halve.

No matter what I feel through this sickness, I want to do what I want, with you, otherwise I won't stay sane.

To the current me, of whom you approve so much, your smile is captivation, your acts, persuasion, your eyes, its bane.

I want to do, to you, and with you, the beautiful things I don't know about because I've done them with no one.

If you simply willed for it, you would not believe the kind of change I could incur, and person I could become.

I would chase you with abject selflessness through every star we count laying under the night sky's light pours,

No matter how long I stare, there is no other pattern, no celestial body I could fixate on... So I turn my head, and stare at yours.

But to engage further, my core motivation I would breach,
For, as with a star, I'm meant to stare, appreciate... But never to reach.
