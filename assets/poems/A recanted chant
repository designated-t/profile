For an undeserving other:

I've taken a path quite different from yours,
So close, a vector still, so far across,
But destiny seems to have opened doors,
For two parallel lines to finally cross.

And so I met this princess, so quaint,
A girl so invisible, she thinks she's faint
But exudes a humble, yet glowing might
Even hell she had managed to set a-light

Yet the cause for your suffering, your empathy.
Your first recourse, your easiest tendency.
You did not lose it. It became your pillar,
Its such kind nature that breaks my vigor.

I see you often, I'm already used to you
You deny my compliments, thats okay too
Because every glance at your face
Everytime Im met with its grace
Sees that a smile crosses right across mine
A tightening of my chest, chill down my spine,
And followed, a serenity in surplus to unwind,
Perplexed everytime at the answer to "what's the time?'

I want you to not have to ever say please.
Being with you makes responsibility cease.
You feel so right, and leave me so mellow,
Makes me want to be with you until we're both yellow.
