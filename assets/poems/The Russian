To the tiny girl that packs a punch,
We met only through a pitiful hunch,
You saved me of strife. Truly, I thank you,
But it now feels that my heart you'll chew.

And it isnt your fault.

You've an intensity like no other,
A warmth no cold could smother,
The nature of a caring mother,
And plenty of forgiveness... A fother.

I've learned much, you've showed me so,
And even from your strife, rubbed off some woe,
I accompany it now, all is aligned in row
And I even feel like, to you, I'll always owe.

I enjoyed the movie, the nightly walks,
The games we played, all of the talks,
I collected my thoughts too long, spoke too little,
I now regret I spared words only in whittle...

I mean no discomfort, I'll bleach myself clean,
I want to be in a seat without an incline to the screen,
I want to see your life through my own thought and action,
And make sure you receive all you deserve, every fraction...

I thought I had more time,
I hadn't even made you a rhyme,
Though I had every reason to,
I ponder at every thought of you.

To the russian that packs a punch,
Your stewardship taught me so much...
There is much I would love to intersperse,
But our poetry will stay at the first verse.
