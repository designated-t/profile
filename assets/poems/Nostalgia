A gentle breeze casts my vestments in toil,
An affectionate light saves my mind of turmoil,
And exudes a warmth so welcoming,
An immense allure innocently gesturing.

A comfort that numbs my senses,
Eases the burden the world expenses,
Relaxes my posture, invites me to dance,
Flowing with the most loosening stance.

Oh wintry sun, your flames are tremendous,
Enough to quell the ones in my chest.
It is you of which I wish to be an apprentice,
And instill your radiating lessons, at your behest.

Ill do so gladly in your leave,
I'll become a quintessential pillar of light,
Make sure none must grieve,
And that all are at ease through the night.
