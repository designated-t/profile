I believe myself an explorer
Charting the ancient dust that makes you up

I want to walk the paths you have walked,
The mountains you've climbed,
The stones you've toppled,
The mud you've displaced.

I want to track your being through earth,
Tend to the gardens you've seeded,
The fauna you've caressed, 
And that now tail your every step.

I want to trace around the cracks in your soul, 
Line them with gold
And show you how what's beneath shines
With the might of stars,
The gentle warmth of a fireplace,
And the softness of the moon.

You are the crucible from which I wish to be reforged,
The currents with which I wish to travel,
The ideas that span the sanity and insanity of my mind,
You are my poetry, you are my art,
The gaps between letters, the breaks between paragraphs,

And I want to be the final dot that ends you,
But with whom you continue on...
