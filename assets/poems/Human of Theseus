Flow in state of neglect,
But a sudden poise of intellect
Has given me currents ever so perfect
For the purpose of changes to intersect.

Which ones to keep?
What purpose serves change if not betterment to seek?
But what may betterment be? 
Might I ditch only that which makes me weep,
Or strand a bargain for nuance to sodden at a rate of time not at all cheap?

It seems, however, change happens even in moments of will most derranged,
And there are parts of me from which I thought I'd never sever.
But everything in me has changed,
Yet I am more me than ever.
