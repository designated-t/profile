What I ponder, around it wanders,
About the fireflies around the city,

Such wonder, persistent lighting and thunders,
Though clouding my mind'scape, pity.

May I escape this tonight? Unlikely,
My thoughts don't follow a clock,
When I wish, they never sit idly,
But no dreams ever they block.

A shame this working frame may blame my thinking flame, yet, disdain, fully-without, famed are the enflamed, yet tamed city fireflies whose blame it is that I am up.
