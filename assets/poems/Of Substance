Let no thoughts make sense as I write this piece,
I wish to transmit this unadulterated part of my peace,
I love seeing glimpses of the lives of those around me,
I love the innocent sympathy these drunken few allow be,
The enthusiasm, the blatant conversational interest, about any thing,
One could think of nothing but any and all words, from naught, will spring.

I love watching as the layers of these complex persons slowly shed, 
How each minute that passes tells a tale of new truths that may lie ahead,
Where restrictions go to die, and where, while maybe a few lies are bred,
There is a return to a child-like compulsory ideation to even the most assuming airhead.

I love watching the smart, mature, yet inebriated few stumble about,
Reminds me that we all humans are with problems, worries, burnout, 
Possessing flames that one day will die out,
And of whom, behind every surgically calculated action, lies immeasurable doubt.

Allow there to be comfort and appreciation in this outer portion of an inner sanctum,
I'll be glad, when I'm gone, to have lived it, pursued it, respected it and, in the end, thanked him.
