I have always hated goodbyes
Most always seem so vain

Because "I'll see you"... Sure.

I'll see you when I see the pinks,
I'll see you when I hear the blues,
When my pocket rings,
When I am changing a photo's hues,

I'll see you as leaves fall from trees,
As the flowers are pecked by the bees,
I'll see you among the stars,
I'll spot you from here to Mars.

I'll see you somewhere... Anywhere...

You're a pattern I involuntarily seek,
That my brain fundamentally recognizes,
For which my body goes meek,
And that my soul forever prizes.

So yes, I really will. See you.
I always do. Always will.
