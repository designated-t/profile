I indulge this genre of old
Live in it, even enjoy it, i'm told.
I write it, but on an idea I was just sold,
And my position's one more advanced than I'd previously thought to hold

It is such to idealize a thing,
A terrifyingly beautiful being,
A perfect romance, a dance so riviting,
A reality beyond our own, our true unmaking.

Is love not exactly that?
The most terrifying stat,
The idea we most cling to,
We most cherish,
We most yearn for,
We most romanticize,
And desperately seek
Yet, among all our virtue,
It is the one we'll never meet.

Is romance not a horror story?
