In telling you my intentions, I would repeat myself along a book of similar trends.

I'll stare into your eyes and let my body feel any and all things.

To bask in the intermittent warmth of your soul, and break our last supper with bread.

Encroach my heart in strings tied to your unrelenting, careless tread.

Even split it open and allow your whole to sip upon my life,

Perhaps when you've broken mine in half, you'll see yourself as my wife,

Until then, I'll squeeze every last drop I can muster, whatever costs me, alas,

Until then,
I'll be pouring my life and love into your glass
Say when...
