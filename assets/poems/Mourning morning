Awoken in a drench of sweat,
At an hour insufficient, I'll bet.
I check the time, I set no chime,
Five thirty six in the morn,
No wonder there was no warn.

I get up to further lower the blinds,
The streaks leak hazy, white and cloudy lines.
I listen in, outside is a subtle patter,
A soft rain reminding only of a tatter.
What murmur you now?
What attempt you to avow?

The rain droplets skip the gaps and clad its flows on my skin,
Mixing with the sorrows of past nights that converge at my chin.
Despite all the hues in which I have done up my home,
No colour today can wash away the monochrome.
