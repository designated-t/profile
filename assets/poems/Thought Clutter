Isolation has purified me in ways comfort could never,
And produced self-entanglement not even a God could sever,
But a murmur of whimsy has preyed upon the prayer of a second
And instilled ponderance about what kind of thought of which one is fecund.

Trebble and nuance. Immense catering and circumstance,
A paralysis in cohesion, a congestion in what's reason,
And able to produce it, with doubt instead polutes it.

A singular mind thinks,
A plethora, all synapses links,
But a plethora is exhausting,
So I'll stick to my own haunting.
Because, in the end:

Isolation had purified me in ways company could never,
And a given me self-reliance that could always defeat a God soever.
