A most expressed, deafened sigh
The cautious finale of the night is nigh

Are we to part, as the kind that exchanges only glances,
Or should I risk it all for a chance at plenty of dances?

I have lived a few too many of these rhymed lives
To not risk anything for a few unrhymed lines

I'd rather cloudy skies and a true kiss' goodbye
Than regret not having done it to ease a sleepless night's cruel "Why..?"

And so I tell you, my sudden half, as I stare onto you:
"The moon looks beautiful tonight...
Right?"
