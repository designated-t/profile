If I could chisel away at stone,
And make you anew once more,
If I could learn it from a tome,
I would devote life, and never bore.

If there had been a better time
For there to be a better place,
I would even trade yours with mine,
And watch you pick up the pace.

If I were God's one disciple,
I would part seas for you,
All of your struggle, stifle,
And return your love, too.

If I had been the true divine,
And humanity I could re-sow,
I would mix up the brine
That makes only you, you.

If I was graced as Creator
I would devote my omniscience.
Alas, I am but love's realtor,
With knowing, comes insignificance.

Dost would scream and moan
(Although somewhat in vain)
That the price of loving someone
Is never loving anyone again

But I challenge that blasphemy,
And it will take a long while
For you to say you love me,
Without fearing saying goodbye.

And she parted without saying goodbye.
