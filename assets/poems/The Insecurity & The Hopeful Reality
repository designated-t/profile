Oh how I saw you back then,
In folds my mind would bend.
Your perspective, I respected,
A strong rose, I detected.

I was shocked

On our first meet, I was elated,
It seemed you weren't, became abated.
Your murmurs dulled in regularity,
Assumption became my only parity.

I felt rocked

The willow became so sickly,
And my mind, oh so prickly...
Yet I watched you move about,
Without a word, giving out.

I feel mocked

Slowly, my heart entangles in you,
I wish to know, is yours so too?
Because If not, I am saddened,
What of the kiss? I'm flattened...

I've been locked

So tell me, sickly willow,
Your heart says it how?
Do you still wish for it to be,
Or has your tendency ceased for me?

Oh how I saw you back then,
In folds my mind would bend.
Your perspective, I respected,
A strong rose, I detected.

I was shocked

On our first meet, I was elated,
It seemed you weren't, maybe abated.
I hope you know I meant no harm,
I wished only warmth with my arm.

To you, I docked

You told me of a slower path,
Yet felt excitedly about our math.
One kisses one, becomes only two,
But where's it gone, and also you?

I wish we talked

I want to know of your excitement,
I feel it still, though of more, I meant.
My heart slowly sips upon your pyre,
Ever heavier now than the day prior.

I feel overstocked

So tell me, sickly willow,
Your heart says it how?
I hope you still wish for it to be,
And that your tendency hasn't ceased for me.
