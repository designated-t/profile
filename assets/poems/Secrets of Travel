I've seen many take for granted
What they've lovely decanted,
A source of hate and disgusting poise,
All for a bit of unfaithful and untruthful noise.

Very ugly people,
Senselessly evil.

Here I am, assumingly unaware,
But I know well enough you're laying in bare,
Doubt you will spread,
A young boy's mind you'll tear,
Because of selfish, pushy desires,
Incredibly ignorant of what love requires.

A turntable, the success that follows,
But you'll remember your standards of hollows,
Because anything else you get is callows,
Child-like compulsion in thought hallows,
And everything you'll regret in the morrows,
Because you'll sit in a bed of sorrows.
