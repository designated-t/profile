I'd heard that loving was freeing
Though never have I felt more constricted
With a duty so dire, for only my being
Uniquely, to you I was self-conscripted

I found your arm a pleasure to hold on to
Within my choice to indulge this tangle,
And in my fears that I would bore you,
Thought it great to dance, my first tango

We were elated,
Never one I've felt so close to
Never once I felt baited
And all my thoughts, covered in you
As though fated

We were collapsed,
In a fit of rage, confused,
I ran, and regret made the motion,
I'm sorry, you did not deserve that notion

I'm not sure what to add.
I'd write you in Portuguese
But I fear I'd cry like mad,
Because no feeling ever made me cease
More than telling you "Amo-te" and being at peace
