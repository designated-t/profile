My drawing teacher had a funny way to grade:
17 is for the best student,
18 is for the teacher, how prudent.
19 is for the disciplinary master,
20 is for God, something likely preached by a pastor.

But a grade is a foul concept,
And the teacher is the one that grades.
Among all of the ones around, you're the only prospect
For which I would reenact the crusades.
