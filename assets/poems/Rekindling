It seems that a glance was all it took,
To tangle me about and around your hook,
Draw me into the pages of your book,
And leave me yearning for yet another look.

I thought myself a bit colder,
And, over the years, a whole lot bolder,
Maybe my core, too long, I've let smoulder,
Perhaps its time I let another on my shoulder...

Thoughts that come to mind,
From weakness, one of many better left behind.
I'm not quite certain whether I'm yet inclined,
To let myself become, once again, intertwined.

But my fire spills over with your mire,
Ever heavier now than the day prior,
Maybe it is help now that I require...
... Or maybe it is destiny I should let transpire.

It seems a glance was all it took,
But none others that any snook,
In any similar way, my core, have shook,
And the smoulder in me, managed to stoke.

Those dark coals, cut in half by a confident stare,
Your contagious enthusiasm reels in my snare,
And that reaping smile, it just isn't fair...

A hole in my psyque you'll inevitably tear,
Leaving myself open, my soul in bare,
Hoping, with you, myself I could share,
Maybe, this time, a connection without compare.
