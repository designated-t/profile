I give and give, with duress.
Attempt my best to impress.
With my honesty, I caress,
But all in vain, I digress.

While in pain, I swallow,
With disdain, I wallow,
I leave a stain, unhallow,
With this brain, so callow...

But in this moment, I insist,
If you'll just allow me to exist,
I tell you still what I told you then,
For what I dont spill, I'll use this pen.

I am sorry for your scars
And thank you for not leaving
I know we've had our spars...
In truth, they've had me weeping
But I want none to just be memoirs
Because I want to be what truly makes you appreciate living
