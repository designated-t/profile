Who are you?
Which version is true?
You've felt my touch,
Through your hair, my brush,
Fingers interlaced, dancing with yours,
About your body, you've given me tours...

Yet... I haven't felt it.

Why was every sign,
Every play of twine,
Every single kiss,
Every feeling amiss,
Why were they all so distant,
And some, nonexistent..?

Because I thought I caressed your soul,
I thought I felt you fully, a liminal whole,
Made a place for yours to reside, next to mine,
But now I wonder if I've even passed the line.
Was my love only skin-deep?
Have I let a mistake seep?
Did you change through a need,
Or were you always this breed?

I'll always wonder, for I've been forbidden to send a letter,
Any I may will surely be intercepted. Perhaps for the better.
Still, I am certain of something my intuition always said,
It was as though I felt you through a glove made of lead.
