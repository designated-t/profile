Should the weather be cooler,
My water bottle fuller,
This pencil a bit sharper,
And this jacket much larger?

Should we feel the need to talk at all?
Maybe you'd prefer to never call?
Are my words filling your mind with distractions unnecessary,
Or are your priorities that far ahead of what weight mine may carry?

I seek impact, the same as you.
My interest is intact, is yours too?
Then so be it, I want to know you better
But in the meantime...

... Please, pray tell: How's the weather?
