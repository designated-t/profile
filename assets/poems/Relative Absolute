"You're the most beautiful in the world."
The strangest words to have ever been hurled,
Such a confusing paradox. An absolute.
Instead of telling this lie, I would rather be mute.

Beauty is relative, that much is true,
So should the elative determine the cue?
Is the most of any, the perfect at such?
Or is the first of many supposed to mean this much?

Though weary, I senselessly ponder the innards of meaning,
Digging a hole deeper and, into it, leaning,

It was then I saw her,
And I was confused no longer.
