A repeated inflection,
A poised introspection,
An self-righteous allure,
Each poison's inner cure.

You've got my same scars,
Recluse, excusing the bars,
A most solitary alignment,
And, among ourselves, confinement.

My one way wonder,
My greatest source of sonder,
In trajectory to touch,
And of more, oh so much...

... Yet never achieving such.
