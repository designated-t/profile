I've spent a great deal of time
Spilling muses and wasting mine
I feel misused, bothered, and uncomfortable,
Yet inexperienced still. This used to feel governable.

I've tired of those that seek other muses,
I've been honest, caring, with many other uses,
It seems all others want is abuse and drink,
I seem insufficient, am I truly the weakest link?

I wish not to refrain from touch,
To hug another, a meaningful crutch,
To overdo it, my being's must
I want not to scare of it, and act just

To boundlessly pour myself to another,
A dance of two, a most chaotic fother,
A tappestry unwoven, twirling till blue,
An oddity of soul, perhaps one split in two
(A tappestry unwoven, a twirl's dismay)
(An oddity of souls, a two flower bouquet)

So I would always have a friend
(So we would always have a friend)
