A mind is a cradle of the past,
Though obscured in a shadow's cast.
Thoughts that bring one true,
Into, and out, of the blue.

Should one remember...

And these thoughts are one's own,
They make up what we do and don't,
They may take up space and time,
But of more value, my poetry and rhyme.

And also those that linger...

Even some in quaint ephemerality,
Or perhaps in my own brutal eternality,
I'll cradle your heart in de-thorned roses,
As is what any thought of you poses.

And I sure hope it is so...
Forever.
