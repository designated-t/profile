Clouds stain the sky,
A trailing wind passes by,
Tempting the leaves to dance,
And slowing to give flowers a chance,
Cooling, carrying away in swarms
What the sun's providence warms,
Causing ripples in the landscape,
Everything swerves, from the air,
The fields, all this greenery,
Plenty of hues,
Disturbed peacefully,
To the blue, 
Each piece playing a part,
And returning to the start.

The vapours in my cup upthrust,
Crumbling the fannings to tea dust,
Spiraling down, they swirl away,
Twirling with the turbulences in disarray.

Feeling... Calmly... Whatever deludes,
Proving with beautiful verisimilitudes
