You who feels most my absence, 
Wife to a sailor, feverish impresence, 
Gives value to my stride, my efforts, 
For whom I would cross oceans and deserts,

And certainly, you too

Your impermanence, my unmaking, 
Your every move, breathtaking, 
The conscious, independent few, 
I'm obsessed. I adore you.

How can something so small mean so much?
How can your mere stare compel my touch?
How come l've this dire need to care for you?
How come I intellectualize everything you do?

With whom any hug will scare any fright,
My keepsake, my guardian of the night,
With you, I can choose to play no games, 
And just love fully, unconditionally, forever... As were always my aims

And the original, the warrior,
Most of my life's ideal storier.
No occasion would ever be ideal for your
departure,
Since that moment, solitude has been a
most assured torture.

I miss you so. I hope you're well.
My memories of you this wounded heart
will inevitably quell.
