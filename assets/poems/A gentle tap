We talked, we met, and we feasted,
Ignoring the food, we spoke more instead,
About it all, about the past, the brutal honesty,
And as I engorge in my own... I feel, in amnesty,

A gentle tap on my knee...

And suddenly, what felt like a storm,
Quickly became null. It lost all form.
It is in the past,
It can no longer last,
You were a present and candid reminder
That there's reason to forever be kinder.
To everyone, but especially myself.

And in my thoughts of appreciation,
Of you, and by yours my incantation.
You took my heart then, absolutely elated,
And as my ruminations incrementally weighted,

A gentle tap on my hand...

A frosty touch that warms and shelters, I felt then,
A naturally endowed gift by a personified winter wren,
The warm sun by its shade, as though intentionally made,
And though cool winds blew along through the branches' blades,
No danger I felt, because,

With a gentle tap on my heart,
And within the span of a few beats,
You made it stop.
