The seats were empty,
The showroom, dark.
The stage, deserted and yet you still played your act,
An intentional mark.

Yester night was warm,
The sheets were to the side,
And to no curfew we chose to abide,

Tonight is cold, has one trembling in chill,
But more nights are yet to come, colder still.
