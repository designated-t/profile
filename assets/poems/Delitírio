Inibriated, alone with my words 
To feel a beat, to play the cords, 
We feel so much in close mutuality 
With an art so far from rationality 

Are we naturally miss-taught, 
Or inhibited to simple thought? 
To question this against a despot 
Brings about so much distraught. 

So what if it brings about my fall,
But brings also, the most of all,
A blissful connection to the holy three,
That constricts some, but sets me free. 

Should this poison be taken as such? 
Or may it be villainized far too much? 
For only those that take it not, 
Feel it differently from the poisoned lot. 

Could it bring truths forbidden, 
Or destroy ideas doubt ridden? 
Could the key to a life's puzzle 
Be that thought to massively tousle? 

As long as those that make the rules 
Toy with naught but unneeded tools 
Well have a stone-bound unhinged grasp 
On something that could free a fate's past 

Maybe this poison could be the cure 
For something so alien, yet so pure. 
Those that dance may appear crazed,
To whom, by the melody, is totally unfazed
