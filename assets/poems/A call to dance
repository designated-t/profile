I see you looking,
I love your stares,
My heart you're hooking,
Shall we skip the mere glares?

Im not a fan of this lack of contact,
And I'm not the best at a love act,
But I can write a fancy letter with a hidden meaning,
So I'll throw one in this proverbial pond,
Perhaps you'll then find cause for my reeling:

Hello, from a fellow fan of jupiter hearts,
Enjoying you, I am, as you enjoy the arts,

Nothing compares, so far there's no doubt.
You're an oasis in a world full of drought.
To my mind you're a force that could reshape,
A relaxed pleasure in an ecstatic landscape,
Rocking my mind, into circumstance,
Ending any turmoil, however, with a simple glance,

Candidly expressing a mindful romantic harm
In what time it takes me to reach your arm,
And invite you to dance, hoping you'll take mine... 

... To a sound no others can hear, but with which our thoughts will rhyme.
