Floral patterns on wine glasses,
Taking shape in the taste that passes,
Complex in variety, simple in intent,
And, in making good times last, hellbent.

Down enough and you'll be sickly,
Unwary, though weary and unprickly,
Enough to make any soul's echoes lively,
And enough to break any ice nicely.

But I feel that,
Even as the fill of my glass sours,
Any wine I sip on with you tastes of flowers.
Any moment with you makes sure any problem cowers.
Any thing I do with you feels like roaming a field of flowers.

You make me forget how much I hate giving flowers...

You make it so it is you with whom I want to spend my last hours.
