A careless mistake has been made,
A portion of consciousness I've waged,
Plentiful, upon my earnings, I've laid,
No matter in how many bets I've engaged.

Only a fool is poor alone, 
Or so, by fools, I'm told.
It discredits all I've grown,
Behind the drool of "just be bold".

You are decadence of thought.
Love for self and another cannot overlap,
For, within, there is what cannot be bought,
And thought without another is simply a trap.

The pain of loving one more than aplenty,
Is to never love another the same,
Or at all.
This also goes for the self that is, currently.
Not one cares enough,
Nor tries enough,
Feels enough.

Solitude is not itself alone,
It is the fear that derives from this notion,
The fear of never surpassing what has shone,
Never one of a whole through any emotion,
And I'll settle for nothing less.
