Sometimes lazy,
Forgetful, hazy,
A stubborn recluse
Who is often obtuse,
I am a problem very much in need of repair,
Perhaps in me there is much I should tear,

No, I'm not all I wish to be,
But everyday, I still impress me,
For just a year ago I was very different,
And I am now much of what I wished to be,

And that is magnificent :)
