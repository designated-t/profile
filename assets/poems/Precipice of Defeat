I am a vessel brimming with unspoken words,
But I am nothing. Even now, broken in thirds.
A causeway for ideas not yet explored
And few are the ones that truly seek this hoard.

I'm not like what those in the past called kings,
I am the void that gives form to all things,
The strength given to one whose will has long expired,
The last swings by a warrior who's deathly tired,
And who now stands on the precipice of defeat.
At the edge of oblivion, collective ideals accrete,
His body may lay in tatters,
His mind so fragile, it shatters,
But I am the remembrance that scatters.

You cannot kill me in a way that matters.
