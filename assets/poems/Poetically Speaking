We're

A virtue of sensation, 
A muse seen in all,
An eccentric fixation,
However small,
In the senses of things to become as they are,
And the subsequent proverbial fall
Into introspection.

Like strings tying the end of interlaced declarative pours,
Faces with the most unassuming cores,
Misdirection, romantization, lies and other synonyms,
Overflowing with our licour at the rims,
Many with nothing, 
One with everything,

Hallowed in our hollow form, 
Echoing a desperate howl within,
Waves following no norm,
Especially underneath the skin,

Different.

And as my own feelings coarsen,
With a simple psychological hop,
Especially for the right person,
Words will bubble up like soda pop.
