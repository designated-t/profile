Another has disappeared,
At least I know this one's story.

In the end, things were cleared,
Though I'd rather not have had to seek this glory.

Is it even glorious to know? 
Am I triumphant in this woe?

...

Eitherway, I'm getting ahead of myself...
I'll just wish you a safe return back to yourself.
