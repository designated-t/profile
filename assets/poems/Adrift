Lost in these plenitudes
Ignoring any and all feuds
Except those in my mind,
All a sight of hind.

Twiddling with proverbial strings,
Careful with what touch brings.
Yet any may come and knot,
What I've wittingly kept not.

Such is the point of human,
To do what not-human can,
To flow against the current,
As though afloat they weren't.

But I think in this differing way,
Disregard extremes and simply sway,
Disallow control to all of my form,
And naturally survive any storm.

However my fingers write,
It is not my will, quite right.

I am adrift
