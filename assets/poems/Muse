Questions unanswered,
Feelings ever hampered,
A lie that hurts the soul,
A sight at a midnight stroll,
A plain white canvas the mind fills,
Any thing that may create new thrills,
Maybe their absence,
Or when nothing makes sense.

Naught tells what dance they'll make,
Nor if any attention they'll take,
But all come from within,
From underneath the skin,
Even muscle and bone,
A purely metaphysical zone,
Where what is felt flows smoothly,
In a state of orderly chaos, loosely,
And as my own feelings coarsen,
With a simple psychological hop,
Especially for the right person,
Words will bubble up like soda pop.
