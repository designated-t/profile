A bundle of green poses a great analogy,
The lack of their care saddens me,
A mix of faun and flora brood alike,
The welcome consequence of a mind's seiche.

Though with each exchange,
Through whatever death may rearrange
What holds this trade up are the flowers
And the care for them, the bowels.
For nothing ruminates without their heed,
No inner peace, no good idea will breed.

The value an offering might bring:
A flower, sometimes the right thing,
A bouquet, so ever enticing,
Yet, a garden, a haven thriving.

Offer your own as the greatest chore,
To tend to yourself has made you quite sore,
For it is your love and affection for a rose,
That'll determine the uniqueness it will pose.
