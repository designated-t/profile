The oceans and skies, which one may lay below?
Drifting, patterning, whichever way they flow,
One seems still, yet always moving,
Another with peaks of wave crests, ever colluding,
Scratching the still blue, 

At the golden hour,
When bright is lour,
The sea employs many a glistening twinkle,
As though she wishes too for stars to sprinkle,
Sparkle about her magnitude,
Gilded flakes to give her attitude,
But she needs none more.

Whatever way this place's intricacies go,
I've told myself to not be confused so.
A place of rest, a capital reward for my life's work,
A graveyard for the prickly emotions that may lurk.

So many parallels, each blue copies the other,
The movement of the grains provides me no bother,
They sand away some layers, the sun melts the rest,
My core is exposed and I can't help but not feel stressed,
The waves scatter away the sky in attempt to blurry,
Much like the way this place dissipates my every worry.
