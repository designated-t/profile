Crows enjoy shiny things,
And whatever beauty shiny brings,

Why might that be? 
What does it mean to me?

The love for things conspicuous,
While not being so, quite suspicious.

Though the cause seems far more tame,
And what clouds our judgement is, simply, their fame.

In a world of shadows, death and the impractical,
They seek the attention given to things valuable.
As we ornate ourselves, the crows do their pilfering,
Hoping we'll like the things they bring as an offering.

We all do what we must for an end, 
All a crow wants is... A friend.
