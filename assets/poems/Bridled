Oh past tendencies
How have you caught so many so.
Oh last frequencies,
It seems, back to you, all go.

Am I different? 
Perhaps... Indifferent?
The past does not bother me,
I do my best to allow others to be.
And myself too.

Why would I devolve into history,
When so much seems to be ahead,
I'd rather face all this mystery,
Than, through familiarity, tread.

What a virtue it is to learn from the past.
If mistakes were made, those you shouldn't recast.
But alas, nothing to do,
Just a pattern rife in all as of late.
Weak minds steer into the path of an old mate.
