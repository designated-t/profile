Waves wave away at the sea,
And the wind blows, as it does.
A storm may come,
A tide may rise,
Yet waves will wave away at the sea.

A joy it was to be your air,
Your every nuisance, the second in bare,
Eyes to taste, lips to stare,
And none a bite made any sense make sense

Should we match?
I guess not.
I thought so,
Yet believed it not... 
So.
I guess no sense truly made any sense.

Concluding, I'll sail away,
Not-quite-so-merrily as I go,

Yet waves will wave at the sea,
Winds will blow, as they do.
A storm came,
The tide rose,
Yet waves still wave away at the sea.
