How might I possibly describe,
As a human, this intellectual bribe,
I find that, to be, it has no reason,
And I might construe it as mind's treason.

How can we expect whats relative,
Not to any absolute, but to one's own narrative,
To be desired, needed and never replaced,
A function functionally made to be chased.

And would one of its making,
Be so without faking,
One of such singular purpose,
To fullfill everything that urged us.

Would perfection know how to feel?
Would perfection understand what it is to kneel?
Would it betray itself for another,
Or hold off its own if it'd rather?

Would it have its own mind?
I say it should be cognitively blind.
But no such human could ever be so,
We require too much, and we grow.

Perhaps, then, this flawed concept,
Shows really how our priorities are kept,
We want intellectual and emotional entropy,
Perfection would have to be so, in many ways, messily.
A sum of halves but never whole, 
A spectrum of features making up a soul,
Differences and equals that clad a mind,

Perfection is an idea taken from someone's behind.
