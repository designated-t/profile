To the lady in the red sweater,
The one of yester night,
The one whose eyes ignored weather,
Only to meet up with mine.

I might have cherished you so,
And did, all night, regardless,
For a few brief minutes, your beau,
I was, and my feelings, guardless.

And we danced, we twirled, we toiled,
With eachother and no others,
Maybe our bodies could have coiled,
And some may have come, tried for us,

But we fixated,
And indulged,
And never more we met.

To the lady in the red sweater,
Whose eyes shined brighter than the stage,
I would've loved to eye you in any weather,
But this book was destined for only a page.
