I've pondered upon the view of a third,
And, being added to a pair, In my mind it's occurred,
That perhaps all ideals incurred,
Blurred and stirred,
How might a single's experience demurred
The lengthy compression of underlying feelings deferred
To beyond the cast of any good word.

Whored and referred,
You're a pain with no herd,
An accretion of cohorts
Even to any who might've previously averred.
Even any stare disregarded, in the past undeterred,
Whose bottom became without undergird,
You're a blossom for any significant bird,
But for a finale, you're an ending for charisma unheard,
Uncured, conferred as...
Absurd.
