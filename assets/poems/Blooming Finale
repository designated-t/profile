It's time to move,
The seasons change,
I hope my roof
Does not derange
By the summer simmer,
The fallen winds,
And wintery shimmer
Which life rescinds.

Greater times, all most joyous,
What might try and destroy this?

Oh.
Though truly forgetful
I am, too, most regret-full,
This moment, take time to amend it:

It was spring when the world ended
