We speak so much of it, its mysterious
But it is curious

How we tale so much of pain
We talk all about how it is vain
And protest so much about inter-personal disdain

Yet we do it all the time... To eachother
To ourselves
To that one person we refused to listen to,
To some man on the street,
To some begger trying to get back on his feet

And it is serious
The hypocritical, selective empathy
So many ask so much of it yet provide none to thee,
Too many speak volumes of sympathy,
Yet none resides within their tendencies

It is serious.
